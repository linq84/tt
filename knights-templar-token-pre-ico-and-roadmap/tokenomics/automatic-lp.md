# Automatic LP

For every buy, sell or send transaction of Knights Templar Token, 2% goes to the liquidity pools.

Initial post ICO LP pairings will include but not limited to BNB, BUSB, USDT, BTC, ETH.

Increasing liquidity will allow the LP to grow regardless of current market price.

This liquidity becomes equity, collateral and staked insurance, once again raising the price floor and security each and every time a transaction is made.
