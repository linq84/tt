# Transaction Fee Summary

Knights Templar Token was made to reward holders and investors. Every transaction (buy, sell, or send) has a 10% fee:

* 2% goes to the liquidity pools, decreasing price volatility and adding to your staked Knights Templar Token income and banking services.
* 2% is distributed amongst all holders as reflection income, including the burn wallet.
* 2% is sent to the burn wallet directly making Knights Templar scarcer with each transaction.
* 2% goes to buyback tokens on sell orders which then also get burnt and added to Liquidity pools (50/50).
* 2% goes to the Developers Marketing & Charity Wallet (50/50).

22% of the total supply will be sent to the dead wallet on the day of our launch on Pancake Swap.

The dead address will be the biggest holder.

The dead wallet will continue to accumulate more tokens through reflection and on each transaction, removing them from circulation. These mechanics will further increase the scarcity of the Knights Templar Token making it the optimal hyper-deflationary, passive income generating cryptocurrency.
