# Manual Burn

We have decided to burn 22% of the total supply in order to allow the reflection and passive income system to grow organically. Knights Templar Token is a truly hyper-deflationary token by design. The supply keeps decreasing with every transaction. 2% of every transaction is burned. In addition, the Dead Wallet is a wallet holder for reflection interest, with 22% of the supply, a portion of reflections from transactions goes to the burn wallet too.
