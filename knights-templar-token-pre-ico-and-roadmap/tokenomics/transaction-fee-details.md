# Transaction Fee Details

Knights Templar Token has a 10% Transaction Fee that rewards holders and integrates mechanisms that will allow the protocol to grow over time as the token is traded:

* 2% goes to the liquidity pools, decreasing price volatility and adding to your staked Knights Templar Token income.
* 2% is distributed amongst all holders as reflection interest, including the burn wallet
* 2% is sent directly to the burn wallet making Knights Templar scarcer with each transaction.
* 2% goes to buyback tokens on sell orders which then also get burnt and added to liquidity 50/50.
* 2% also goes to the Developers Marketing Wallet & Charity Wallet 50/50

As discussed in the 'Transaction Fee Summary' page, there is a 10% transaction tax on every transfer. Below you can find a full breakdown of the fee structure:
