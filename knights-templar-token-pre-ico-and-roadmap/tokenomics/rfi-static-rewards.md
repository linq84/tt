# RFI- Static Rewards

In addition to rewards, Knights Templar Token holders also generate passive income from reflection interest AND interest bearing LP's. 2% of every transaction is redistributed to all Knights Templar Token holders in reflection. This happens automatically at the time of the transaction/s and will be reflected in your token balance.

The burn address is a holder of 22% of supply so each reflection cycle also helps deflate the supply.
